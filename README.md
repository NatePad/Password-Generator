# How to [Git Gud](https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/git-gud/) feat. Password Generator

The live app is hosted by GitHub Pages at [natepad.github.io/Password-Generator](https://natepad.github.io/Password-Generator/).

A common general question I'm being asked as a coding bootcamp TA is, "How do I improve?" I've given this question some thought and would like to offer a response here.

1. Try to come up with a solution to a coding exercise or problem on your own before searching for a direct solution to the problem online and copy/pasting someone else's solution. This is really going to strengthen your understanding of the core concepts of coding.

2. When the inevitable happens and you do search for a solution to the current coding challenge online, whatever that challenge may be, **don't copy/paste someone else's code directly**. Look at the provided answer, digest it and make sure you understand their thought process and their workflow, then close that browser tab and type it out yourself.

3. There are usually several different ways to approach a coding challenge. After you come up with a solution, try to think of a different one. Once you have two different approaches, code them both out! Trying multiple solutions and comparing them really helps exercise the part of your brain that can grapple the logic puzzles that come with programming.

On this vein, I wanted to share a few solutions to the password generator exercise.

## Description:

A few ways to create a random password generator are included in the scripts folder. Toggle the commented script lines at the bottom of [index.html](./index.html) in order to run the different scripts. **Note:** I have left a `console.log()` in each script file for demonstration purposes.

* Levels 1 through 3 show how it's helpful to organize our code by putting variables at the top. Doing so can reveal certain redundancies.

* Levels 4 through 6 show one of many ways that we could use to give letters, numbers, and special characters an equal chance of randomly appearing in the new password. We also look at how we can use objects to help organize things.

* **Level 7, in my opinion, is unnecessarily increasing the code complexity for this example.** Even so, I did it as a demo of how functions can be used to help modularize and organize code in larger applications.
